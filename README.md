# Moon-and-Star-Scene-Generator
This program creates a drawing using the turtle module in Python. It consists of a background with stars, a moon (either a circle or polygon), and buildings with randomly generated shapes and colors. The program has a number of functions that handle different aspects of the drawing, such as creating the background, drawing the moon, and generating the buildings. It is important to run the program at least twice, as the first run may not correctly display the drawing. The program also includes a function to write text on the screen using turtle.
